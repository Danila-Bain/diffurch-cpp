# Diffurch

Diffurch is an in-development header-only library that implements numerical methods for solving differential equations, with main focus on the applicability to many types of problems and usability. Having in mind that main users would be mathematicians. 

The features (will) include:
- symbolic definition of the right hand side of the equation
- support for ordinary and delay differential equations
- support for discontinuous differential equations, including delta terms
- event detection, which allows flexible solution analysis and realization of delta functions in the right-hand-side
